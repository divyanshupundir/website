# Advanced mavlink-kotlin - Part 2: Utilities and extensions

In the [previous part](/blog/advanced-mavlink-kotlin-part-1), we defined some core interfaces for working with MAVLink
systems. Now let's build some utilities and extensions using these interfaces.

The idea is to keep these functions simple and rely on the Kotlin Coroutines API to handle operations like timeouts,
retries and cancellations.

## MavRemoteNode

### Receiving messages

Firstly, let's add an extension function to the `MavRemoteNode` interface to receive a single message of a specific
type.

```kotlin
suspend inline fun <reified T : MavMessage<T>> MavRemoteNode.receive(): T = message
    .filterIsInstance<T>()
    .first()
```

This function will block the current coroutine until a message of type `T` is received. We can also compose it with the
`withTimeout` function.

```kotlin
val hb = withTimeout(5000) {
    mavController.fcu.receive<Heartbeat>()
}
```

This will throw a `TimeoutCancellationException` if a `heartbeat` message is not received from the FCU within 5
seconds. If for some reason, we want to continue execution even if the timeout occurs, we can use the
`withTimeoutOrNull` function instead.

```kotlin
val hb = withTimeoutOrNull(5000) {
    mavController.fcu.receive<Heartbeat>()
}
```

Sometimes, we may want to filter the message further based on some condition. We can add a variant of `receive` that
takes a predicate.

```kotlin
suspend inline fun <reified T : MavMessage<T>> MavRemoteNode.receive(noinline predicate: (T) -> Boolean): T = message
    .filterIsInstance<T>()
    .first(predicate)
```

For example, if we want the `BatteryStatus` message with a specific battery ID.

```kotlin
val batteryStatus = mavController.fcu.receive<BatteryStatus> { it.id == 1.toUByte() }
```

## MavController

### Get and set parameters

Getting and setting FCU parameters are common operations and therefore we will be defining these extension functions on
`MavController`.

```kotlin
suspend fun MavController.getParam(id: String): Float = coroutineScope {
    val ack = async { fcu.receive<ParamValue> { it.paramId == id } }
    delay(10)

    send(
        ParamRequestRead(
            targetSystem = fcu.systemId,
            targetComponent = fcu.componentId,
            paramId = id,
            paramIndex = -1
        )
    )

    ack.await().paramValue
}

suspend fun MavController.setParam(id: String, value: Float): Unit = coroutineScope {
    val ack = async { fcu.receive<ParamValue> { it.paramId == id } }
    delay(10)

    send(
        ParamSet(
            targetSystem = fcu.systemId,
            targetComponent = fcu.componentId,
            paramId = id,
            paramValue = value,
            paramType = MavParamType.REAL32.wrap()
        )
    )

    ack.await()
}
```

There's a lot going on here, so let's break it down.

The `getParam` function sends a `ParamRequestRead` message to the FCU and waits for a `ParamValue` message with the
requested parameter ID. The function returns the parameter value. The `setParam` function sends a `ParamSet` message to
the FCU and waits for a `ParamValue` message with the updated parameter value. The function returns nothing.

You must be wondering why the `async` and `coroutineScope` functions are used here. We could have simply implemented
the `getParam` and `setParam` functions as follows.

```kotlin
suspend fun MavController.getParam(id: String): Float {
    send(
        ParamRequestRead(
            targetSystem = fcu.systemId,
            targetComponent = fcu.componentId,
            paramId = id,
            paramIndex = -1
        )
    )

    return fcu.receive<ParamValue> { it.paramId == id }.paramValue
}

suspend fun MavController.setParam(id: String, value: Float) {
    send(
        ParamSet(
            targetSystem = fcu.systemId,
            targetComponent = fcu.componentId,
            paramId = id,
            paramValue = value,
            paramType = MavParamType.REAL32.wrap()
        )
    )

    fcu.receive<ParamValue> { it.paramId == id }
}
```

The reason why we prefer the former implementations is that they are more robust considering the fact that in certain
cases, the response messages may be received by the underlying `MavConnection` faster than `MavRemoteNode.receive`
is able to make the subscription to the message stream. Therefore, we need to ensure that the subscription is made
before the request is sent. This is where the `async` function comes into play. It allows us to receive the message in
a branched coroutine and await it later in the parent coroutine. The `coroutineScope` block is used for this branching.
Also, the entire function fails if the parent of the child coroutines fails. A `delay` of 10 milliseconds is added to
ensure that the `receive` function has reached the desired state before the request is sent.

### Send commands

Similar to the `setParam` function, sending commands to the different systems is a frequently used operation.

```kotlin
suspend fun MavController.sendCommandLong(
    targetSystem: UByte,
    targetComponent: UByte,
    command: MavEnumValue<MavCmd>,
    confirmation: UByte = 0u,
    param1: Float = 0F,
    param2: Float = 0F,
    param3: Float = 0F,
    param4: Float = 0F,
    param5: Float = 0F,
    param6: Float = 0F,
    param7: Float = 0F,
): CommandAck = coroutineScope {

    val ack = async { fcu.receive<CommandAck> { it.command == command } }
    delay(10)

    send(
        CommandLong(
            targetSystem = targetSystem,
            targetComponent = targetComponent,
            command = command,
            confirmation = confirmation,
            param1 = param1,
            param2 = param2,
            param3 = param3,
            param4 = param4,
            param5 = param5,
            param6 = param6,
            param7 = param7
        )
    )

    ack.await()
}

suspend fun MavController.sendCommandInt(
    targetSystem: UByte,
    targetComponent: UByte,
    frame: MavEnumValue<MavFrame>,
    command: MavEnumValue<MavCmd>,
    x: Int,
    y: Int,
    z: Float,
    current: UByte = 0u,
    autocontinue: UByte = 0u,
    param1: Float = 0F,
    param2: Float = 0F,
    param3: Float = 0F,
    param4: Float = 0F,
): CommandAck = coroutineScope {

    val ack = async { fcu.receive<CommandAck> { it.command == command } }
    delay(10)

    send(
        CommandInt(
            targetSystem = targetSystem,
            targetComponent = targetComponent,
            frame = frame,
            command = command,
            current = current,
            autocontinue = autocontinue,
            param1 = param1,
            param2 = param2,
            param3 = param3,
            param4 = param4,
            x = x,
            y = y,
            z = z
        )
    )

    ack.await()
}
```

These have been implemented in a similar way to the get and set param functions. We send the commands in the parent
coroutine while executing the `MavRemoteNode.receive` function concurrently in a child coroutine, the result of which
is awaited in the at the end.

## Conclusion

We finally have a simple, yet powerful API to interact with MAVLink systems. These functions are robust and can be
easily composed with the Kotlin Coroutines library functions to handle complex transactions. However, a framework
cannot be considered complete unless it addresses error handling and recovery mechanisms. In the next part of this
series, we will build these mechanisms.
