# Advanced mavlink-kotlin - Part 4: Example micorservices

We have finally reached the last part of the series. In this part, we will look at some examples of how to use the API
that we have created thus far to implement MAVLink microservices.

I will be implementing them as simple final classes, but in a production grade application, you would want to properly
define your services as interfaces and implement them in a separate class. Also, you should to use a dependency
injection framework like `Koin` or `Dagger/Hilt` to provide the dependencies to the services, repositories, view
models, etc., based on the architecture of your application.

## TelemetryService

```kotlin
class TelemetryService(
    private val mavController: MavController
) {
    val armed: Flow<Boolean> = mavController.fcu.message
        .filterIsInstance<Heartbeat>()
        .map { it.baseMode.contains(MavModeFlag.SAFETY_ARMED) }

    suspend fun requestDataStreams() {
        requestDataStream(MavDataStream.RAW_SENSORS, 2u)
        requestDataStream(MavDataStream.EXTENDED_STATUS, 2u)
        requestDataStream(MavDataStream.RC_CHANNELS, 2u)
        requestDataStream(MavDataStream.POSITION, 3u)
        requestDataStream(MavDataStream.EXTRA1, 10u)
        requestDataStream(MavDataStream.EXTRA2, 10u)
        requestDataStream(MavDataStream.EXTRA3, 3u)
    }

    private suspend fun requestDataStream(stream: MavDataStream, rate: UShort) {
        mavController.send(
            RequestDataStream(
                targetSystem = mavController.fcu.systemId,
                targetComponent = mavController.all.componentId,
                startStop = 1u,
                reqStreamId = stream.value.toUByte(),
                reqMessageRate = rate
            )
        )
    }
}
```

In this class, we have a `Flow` for the `armed` state. We are filtering the messages from the FCU for the `Heartbeat`
messages and mapping them to the respective values by using the Kotlin Coroutines library functions.

We can also break down a bigger service like `requestDataStreams` into smaller `suspend` functions to make the code
easier to handle.

## CalibrationService

```kotlin
class CalibrationService(
    private val mavController: MavController
) {
    suspend fun calibrateMagnetometerSimple(): Unit = withTimeout(5000) {
        val gpsRawInt = mavController.fcu.receive<GpsRawInt>()

        when (gpsRawInt.fixType.entry) {
            GpsFixType.NO_GPS, GpsFixType.NO_FIX,
            GpsFixType._2D_FIX, GpsFixType.STATIC,
            GpsFixType.PPP, null -> throw MavException("GPS lock required")

            GpsFixType._3D_FIX, GpsFixType.DGPS,
            GpsFixType.RTK_FLOAT, GpsFixType.RTK_FIXED -> Unit
        }

        mavController
            .sendCommandLong(
                targetSystem = mavController.fcu.systemId,
                targetComponent = mavController.fcu.componentId,
                command = MavCmd.FIXED_MAG_CAL_YAW.wrap(),
            )
            .throwIfFailure()
    }
}
```

Let's use this example to look at some of the concepts that we have learned in the previous parts of the series.

1. The `withTimeout` function is used to set a timeout of 5 seconds for the calibration process.
2. We are using the `receive` function to get the `GpsRawInt` message from the FCU.
3. If the GPS is not in the correct state, we will throw a `MavException` with an appropriate message to cancel the
   calibration.
4. We are using the `sendCommandLong` function to send the calibration command to the FCU.
5. The `throwIfFailure` function is used to throw an exception if the command fails.

The `CalibrationService` can be used as follows.

```kotlin
fun executeCalibrateMagnetometerSimple() {
    coroutineScope.launch {
        mavResultOf {
            calibrationService.calibrateMagnetometerSimple()
        }.onSuccess {
            emitAlert("Calibrated successfully")
        }.onFailure {
            emitAlert("Calibration failed: ${it.message ?: "Unknown error"}")
        }
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

In this series, we have learned how to create a MAVLink API using Kotlin. We have also learned how to use the API to
implement MAVLink microservices. Though the examples are simple, you can use the concepts to create more complex
services.

I hope you have enjoyed the series and learned something new. Even if you are not working with MAVLink, you can use the
concepts to architect solutions like this for similar systems.
