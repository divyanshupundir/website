# Advanced mavlink-kotlin - Part 1: Core interfaces

It's been over 2 years since I started working on [mavlink-kotlin](https://github.com/divyanshupundir/mavlink-kotlin)
and around a year since we started using it in production at UrbanMatrix Technologies in our drone software including
our Android-based Ground Control Station (GCS) and our Companion Computer's application layer. The library has come a
long way since then.

The purpose of mavlink-kotlin is to provide the basic building blocks for working with MAVLink systems, while
leveraging the power of Kotlin. But between the low level mavlink-kotlin primitives and the high level MAVLink
microservices we need a layer of abstractions and utilities to make our lives easier.

This blog series will explore some of these. This is the first blog post in a multi-part series for advanced
mavlink-kotlin users. In this first part, we will define some core interfaces and provide their implementations. These
will help us interact with MAVLink systems in a more structured way. In the next parts, we will build on these to
create utility functions and we will also look into structured error handling. Finally, we will see how we can use these
tools to implement some common MAVLink microservices.

## Dependencies

We will be using Gradle along with the following dependencies:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("com.divpundir.mavlink:definitions:$version")
    implementation("com.divpundir.mavlink:connection-core:$version")
    implementation("com.divpundir.mavlink:adapter-coroutines:$version")
}
```

## Interfaces and implementations

### MavSender

```kotlin
interface MavSender {

    val systemId: UByte

    val componentId: UByte

    suspend fun <T : MavMessage<T>> send(message: T)
}
```

mavlink-kotlin does not provide a container for the current system and component IDs. Instead we need to provide them
with each send message call on the `MavConnection` object. An implementation of `MavSender` will handle this for us.

We will implement this as a part of `MavController` defined later.

### MavRemoteNode

```kotlin
interface MavRemoteNode {

    val systemId: UByte

    val componentId: UByte

    val message: Flow<MavMessage<*>>
}
```

While working with MAVLink systems, we often need to interact with several remote nodes. The flight control unit (FCU)
is one of them. An implementation of `MavRemoteNode` will help us make our interaction with FCU easier. In its simplest
form, it will filter out messages from the FCU and provide them as a flow.

```kotlin
internal class FcuNode(
    mavFrame: Flow<MavFrame<out MavMessage<*>>>,
) : MavRemoteNode {

    override val systemId: UByte = 1u

    override val componentId: UByte = 1u

    override val message: Flow<MavMessage<*>> = mavFrame
        .filter { it.systemId == this.systemId && it.componentId == this.componentId }
        .map { it.message }
}
```

Let's also create an `AllNode` implementation which will provide all messages from all nodes.

```kotlin
internal class AllNode(
    frames: Flow<MavFrame<out MavMessage<*>>>,
) : MavRemoteNode {

    override val systemId: UByte = 0u

    override val componentId: UByte = 0u

    override val message: Flow<MavMessage<*>> = frames.map { it.message }
}
```

Similarly, we can create more implementations for different nodes depending upon the nature of the overall MAVLink
system that we are working with.

### MavController

```kotlin
interface MavController : MavSender {

    val fcu: MavRemoteNode

    val all: MavRemoteNode
}
```

The `MavController` provides a single point of interaction with the MAVLink system. Though it looks simple, it is
powerful enough to handle complex MAVLink transactions. Let's implement it.

```kotlin
internal class MavControllerImpl(
    override val systemId: UByte,
    override val componentId: UByte,
    private val mavConnection: CoroutinesMavConnection
) : MavController {

    private val mavFrame = mavConnection.mavFrame

    override val fcu: MavRemoteNode = FcuNode(
        mavFrame = mavFrame
    )
    
    override val all: MavRemoteNode = AllNode(
        frames = mavFrame
    )

    override suspend fun <T : MavMessage<T>> send(message: T) {
        mavConnection.sendUnsignedV2(systemId, componentId, message)
    }
}

fun MavController(
    systemId: UByte,
    componentId: UByte,
    mavConnection: CoroutinesMavConnection
): MavController = MavControllerImpl(
    systemId = systemId,
    componentId = componentId,
    mavConnection = mavConnection
)
```

## Conclusion

Now that we have defined the core interfaces, we can start building on top of them. The next parts of this series will
focus on building utility functions and error handling mechanisms.
