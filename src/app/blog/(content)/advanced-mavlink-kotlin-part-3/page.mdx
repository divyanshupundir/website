# Advanced mavlink-kotlin - Part 3: Error handling

In the previous parts of this series, we built a simple yet powerful API to interact with MAVLink systems. We
implemented core interfaces and utility functions to handle complex transactions. Let's get to final important part of
this framework, i.e. error handling.

## Sources of errors

Errors can occur at various levels of the communication stack.

1. Transport layer: The connection can be lost with the remote system.
2. Protocol layer: The remote system can send an invalid message.
3. Local system: Sometimes the local system can receive messages that are protocol compliant but are invalid
   semantically.
4. Remote system: The remote system can send an error messages. These are usually responses to commands indicating that
   it was not executed successfully or that the parameters were invalid.
5. Timeouts.

The first two cases are handled by mavlink-kotlin itself. IOExceptions are thrown when the connection is lost and
invalid or corrupt messages are ignored. For the third case, the user need to implement their own checks.

To propagate and manage errors for the last two cases, let us define a custom exception class.

## MavException and error propagation

```kotlin
class MavException(
    message: String,
    cause: Throwable? = null
) : Exception(
    message,
    cause
)
```

The need for this class arises from the fact that MAVLink error messages are not exceptions and are not propagated as
such. We need to convert these messages into exceptions and use Kotlin's exception propagation mechanism to handle them
in the concerned layers of our application.

MAVLink error codes can be cryptic and not very informative to the user of our application. Therefore, when we
implement the MAVLink microservices or transactions, we can use the `message` property of the `MavException` to provide
a more user-friendly error message.

## Managing CommandAck

We'll use a fairly simple extension function to manage possible errors in the `CommandAck` message.

```kotlin
fun CommandAck.throwIfFailure() {
    when (this.result.entry) {

        MavResult.ACCEPTED, MavResult.IN_PROGRESS -> Unit

        MavResult.TEMPORARILY_REJECTED -> throw MavException("Temporarily rejected")

        MavResult.DENIED -> throw MavException("Denied")

        MavResult.UNSUPPORTED -> throw MavException("Unsupported")

        MavResult.FAILED -> throw MavException("Failed")

        MavResult.CANCELLED -> throw MavException("Cancelled")

        MavResult.COMMAND_LONG_ONLY -> throw MavException("Invalid command")

        MavResult.COMMAND_INT_ONLY -> throw MavException("Invalid command")

        MavResult.COMMAND_UNSUPPORTED_MAV_FRAME -> throw MavException("Unsupported")

        null -> throw MavException("Unknown result")
    }
}
```

An example of how to use this function along with the `sendCommandLong` function defined in the previoud part of this
series is shown below.

```kotlin
suspend fun startMission() {
    mavController
        .sendCommandLong(
            targetSystem = mavController.fcu.systemId,
            targetComponent = mavController.fcu.componentId,
            command = MavCmd.MISSION_START.wrap(),
        )
        .throwIfFailure()
}
```

## Managing timeouts

Implementing timeouts is an important part of MAVLink communication. Generally, they can be quite complex to implement.
But the Kotlin Coroutines library provides some powerful tools for the same. When recovering from a timeout is not
possible, we will use the `withTimeout` function to throw a `TimeoutCancellationException`. For cases where we want to
recover from a timeout, we will use the `withTimeoutOrNull` function and handle the `null` case ourself. For `Flow`
based operations, we can use the `Flow.timeout` function.

Implementing a timeout in the start mission example is a simple as wrapping the `sendCommandLong` function in a
`withTimeout` block.

```kotlin
suspend fun startMission(): Unit = withTimeout(2000) {
    mavController
        .sendCommandLong(
            targetSystem = mavController.fcu.systemId,
            targetComponent = mavController.fcu.componentId,
            command = MavCmd.MISSION_START.wrap(),
        )
        .throwIfFailure()
}
```

A caveat to keep in mind while using the `withTimeout` function is that it will silently cancel the coroutines as the
`TimeoutCancellationException` subclasses `CancellationException`. Therefore, it won't be rethrown by the `launch`
block at the top level coroutine.

## Retries

IO failures are common in network communication. Retrying the operation after a delay is a common strategy to handle
these failures. We will rely again on the Kotlin Coroutines library to implement a composable retry function. This can
be used to wrap entire transactions or individual operations in a microservice that can fail.

```kotlin
private suspend inline fun <T> retryWithDelay(
    times: Int,
    delay: Duration,
    block: () -> T
): T {
    repeat(times - 1) {
        try {
            return block()
        } catch (_: Exception) {
            coroutineContext.ensureActive()
            delay(delay)
        }
    }

    return block()
}
```

The function signature is self explanatory. One thing to note is the use of `coroutineContext.ensureActive` as the
operation can fail due to cancellation of the parent coroutine scope. This is important as it makes the function
compliant with the structured concurrency model of Kotlin Coroutines.

## Handling the propagated exceptions

Let us finally define the last function in our API. This function is basically a wrapper around a `try-catch` block,
which returns the result of the block as a `kotlin.Result` type.

```kotlin
suspend inline fun <R> mavResultOf(block: () -> R): Result<R> = try {
    Result.success(block())
} catch (e: Throwable) {
    coroutineContext.ensureActive()
    when (e) {
        is TimeoutCancellationException -> Result.failure(Exception("Timeout"))
        is IOException -> Result.failure(Exception("Connection error"))
        is MavException -> Result.failure(e)
        else -> Result.failure(Exception("Error"))
    }
}
```

## Usage example

Let's take a very simple example to demonstrate the API we have built. We will call the same `startMission` function
defined above and handle the exceptions. I am assuming that the context of this function is an Android `ViewModel`. But
it can be used in any other context that provides a coroutine scope.

```kotlin
fun executeStartMission() {
    viewModelScope.launch {
        mavResultOf {
            retryWithDelay(3, 1.seconds) {
                missionService.startMission()
            }
        }.onSuccess {
            emitAlert("Mission started")
        }.onFailure {
            emitAlert(it.message ?: "Unknown error")
        }
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

We now have all the important tools to build robust MAVLink microservice implementations. The API we have built is
simple, yet powerful. It is also composable, chainable and can be extended to handle more complex use cases. We have
even taken care of handling timeouts, retries and cancellations. This makes it great for building MAVLink transactions.

In the next part, we will take an example of a real-world MAVLink service and implement it using the API we have built.
